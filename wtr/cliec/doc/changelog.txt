===Change Log

====2004.xxx.x
* ClIEController.form now has optional param to automatically wrap the DOM
  form instance in an IEDomFormWrapper instance. 
* ClIEController.initialize now takes an options hash to specify, well, 
  options. Two options at this point: visible and auto_wrap_form. This
  method is still backwards compatible -- if you pass in a boolean then
  the visible variable is set and all others ignored.
* Big refactoring/improvements in accessing DOM nodes:
  * IEDomFormWrapper used to have more funky code for wrapping widgets, now
    it's a more flexible plug-in-ish, polymorphing structure, with a 
    separate subclass to wrap every node type (although only some node types
    are supported yet -- see readme.txt). Supporting additional node types 
    will be much easier to add to the code now.
  * There were some limitations because the previous code favored element 
    nodes instead of all nodes on the form. That's been fixed so that text
    nodes are not discriminated against.
  * Special code nonsense for ASP.NET labels has been removed, though should
    still be supported.
  * A new method_missing on ClIEController itself allows very easy access
    to DOM nodes (in and out of forms) that have id/name attributes. 
    [there is still a little screwiness here using this method to talk to
     some form inputs].
     
    If the page has a link with an id like so:
    
      <a href='http://clabs.org' id=clabs>cLabs.org</a>
      
    You can simply call:

      @iec.clabs

    ... to click the link. 

    Buttons with names/ids can be accessed the same way. 

    You can even add your own method_missing to forward calls to your @iec
    instance so your test scripts can look something like this:

      home
      browse
      apples
      add; add;
      checkout

    (unfortunately, assigning values to text inputs, for example, doesn't
     work with this method_missing approach, because Ruby interprets this:
    
       first_name = 'chris'
       
     as a local variable assignment, and it's never passed to 
     method_missing. So it has to again be:
     
       @iec.first_name = 'chris')
       
* WindowsFormWrapper code for use against .NET Windows Forms that have COM
  interop enabled has been removed. This code lives in a file called 
  dotnet.form.rb that's back in the old cLabs scrapware cliecontroller CVS
  repository. 
       
====2003.362.0
* Builder and Installer working under new RubyForge src tree, etc. Woop.
* waitForIE now sleeps so as not to suck up all CPU time. (thx to Brian
  Candler).
* cl/util/version is now protected so if it doesn't exist the world rolls
  on without -- ain't that important. Thanks to Shashank Date for the bug
  report.
* "Hello world" demo now included in the main file, just run it to see
  things in action. [WHOOPS - took this and moved to example directory...]
* cleaned up the readme.txt some, and included it in the build
* Source re-org and move to RubyForge.net/projects/wtr
* Added mozaxc to cliec/contrib folder with some scripts to help tinker
  around with controlling the mozaxc ActiveX control embedded in a web page.
* Added an example folder with sample code.

====2003.027.0
* No Change Log being kept up to this point. Sorry.
