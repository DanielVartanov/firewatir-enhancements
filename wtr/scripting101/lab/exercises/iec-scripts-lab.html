	<h2 style="text-align:center;">Lab 3: Writing Scripts</h2>

	<p>Now that you&#8217;ve used <span class="caps">IRB</span> to drive Internet Explorer, it is time to create a script. Actually, you&#8217;ll create several. Create each script using Scite, the ruby editor. You may wish to try the commands in <span class="caps">IRB</span> first, to make sure they are right. </p>

	<p>There are two ways to run scripts. One is from the system command line. Type &#8220;ruby script-name.rb&#8221; at the <span class="caps">DOS</span> prompt. The other is to load them into <span class="caps">IRB</span>. Type &#8220;load &#8216;script-name.rb&#8217;&#8221; at the <span class="caps">IRB</span> prompt. Either will run the script, but the latter method may make it easier for you to debug your scripts, because you can check variables and interact with the <span class="caps">IE </span>Controller after the script has run.</p>

	<p>Write these scripts with your partner. As you complete each script, demonstrate it to your instructors.</p>

	<ol>
	<li>   <strong>Start The Day.</strong> Create and execute a script that logs in and
     navigates to the main time clock page, and then starts the day.  </li>
		<li>   <strong>Job Switching.</strong> Create and execute a script that creates two jobs
     and then switches back and forth between them every 5 seconds.  </li>
		<li>  <strong>Test Strategy.</strong> Look over the test ideas you developed at the
     beginning of class.  Write a script for one of them&#8212;or more.  </li>
		<li>  <strong>Record Check.</strong> Start with a user that has no time records. Record
     time sessions for two separate jobs, one session for each. Verify
     that two time records appear. (This last part is a challenge.) </li>
	</ol>

	<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you automate tests, you need to be able to repeat tests much more precisely than when you are testing manually. The &#8216;ensure_no_user_data&#8217; method has been specifically provided as a testability feature for timeclock. You may find it useful.</p>
