h2=. Scripting for Testers

h2=. Lab 4: Verifying Results

* Assertions
* Using a Script-based test harness??

#   *Record Check.* Start with a user that has no time records. Record
     time sessions for two separate jobs, one session for each. Verify
     that two time records appear. (This last part is a challenge.) 

#   *Test Strategy.* Look over the test ideas you developed at the
     beginning of class.  Write a script for one of them--or more.
