h1. Scripting for Testers

h2. Installation Instructions

These instructions describe how to install the software we'll use in
our Scripting for Testers class.

We will be using Ruby (a programming language) and the IE Controller
(a library) on your machine to test server software running on your
instructor's machine. You can also run the server software on your own
machine, if you prefer. This may come in handy if you can't get on the
classroom network, or if you want to use a test technique that
requires a dedicated server.

h3. Hardware Requirements

<B>The class software runs on Windows machines. We recommend Windows 2000
or Windows XP. You should have Administrator privileges.</B>

We believe that it will also work on Windows NT and Windows 98, but we
don't support these in our classes. (Our experience has been that
machines that are still running these operating systems are either too
slow or have other problems and are a drain on our attention. Sorry.)

The IE Controller software requires Internet Explorer and therefore
only runs on Windows. The Timeclock server was developed on a
Macintosh, and should run on any machine supporting Ruby (Unix, Linux,
Windows). The Timeclock "product tests" will not run on Windows using
the mswin build (the one you use for the class). They will run on
Windows using the cygwin build.

h3. Installing the Software

h4. Ruby

The Ruby installer is
"ruby181-12.exe.":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167&release_id=414 

#      Double-click this exe file to install.
#      Select the default installation options (choose all options; install in c:/ruby). 
#      If you are installing as Administrator you don't need to restart windows. Otherwise, you should. 

h4. IE Controller

You will need to install one Ruby library:
"iec.2004.054.0.zip":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=104&release_id=305    

#      Unzip this file into a new directory on your computer. 
#      Start up a command shell. (Start-> Run, enter "cmd".)
#      Change the current directory (cd) to the one you just created.
#      Type "ruby install.rb"

(You can also install this by just double-clicking the install.rb icon
in windows explorer. The problem with this method is that you won't
see any error messages.) 

h4. Scripting Class Materials.

# Copy the contents of the scripting101 into your hard drive, to c:/scripting101. 

h3. Running the Timeclock Server.

You probably won't need to do this for class, since you can use your
instructor's server. Otherwise, here is how to start up a timeclock
server on your machine. 

# In a command window, cd to c:/scripting101/installs/timeclock/bin.
# In a command window, "ruby http-server.rb"
# You can verify the installation by running some of the sample scripts:
** ruby c:/scripting101/lab/solutions/suite.rb
