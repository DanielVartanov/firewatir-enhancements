h1. Scripting Web Tests

h2. Installation Instructions

These instructions describe how to install the software we'll use in
our _Scripting Web Tests_ class (aka _Scripting for Testers_).

We will be using Ruby (a programming language) and Watir
(a library) on your machine to test server software. You can run the
server software on your computer. 

h3. Hardware Requirements

<B>The class software runs on Windows machines. We recommend Windows 2000
or Windows XP. You should have Administrator privileges.</B>

We believe that it will also work on Windows NT and Windows 98, but we
don't support these in our classes. (Our experience has been that
machines that are still running these operating systems often are too
slow or have other problems that we don't have time to support in a class
environment. Sorry.)

The Watir library requires Internet Explorer and therefore only runs on 
Windows. The Timeclock server was developed on a
Macintosh, and should run on any machine supporting Ruby (Unix, Linux,
Windows). (The Timeclock "product tests" will not run on Windows using
the mswin build -- the one you use for the class. They will run on
Windows using the cygwin build.)

h3. Installing the Software

Students are provided with a CD that includes all of the software 
referenced here. For your convenience we also provide links to where 
these materials can be found online.

h4. Ruby

We are currently using 
"Ruby for Windows 1.8.2-14":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167&release_id=1346 
(There are known problems with Ruby 1.8.1-13; don't use it.)

#      Double-click this exe file to install.
#      Select the default installation options (choose all options;
       install in c:/ruby).  
#      If you are installing as Administrator you don't need to
       restart windows. Otherwise, you should.  

h4. Watir

We are using "Watir 1.3.1":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=104&release_id=2164

# Unzip this into c:\watir
# Execute install.rb
# Use all the default installation options

h4. Scripting Class Materials

We are using "Scripting101 1.5.1":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=104&release_id=2160

# Extract the contents of this archive into your hard drive (c:). A
  "scripting101" directory will be created automatically.
  
h3. Running the Timeclock Server.

You will need to start up a timeclock server on your machine. 

#      Start a command shell. (Start-> Run, enter "cmd".)
#      Enter "cd c:\scripting101\timeclock\bin".
#      Enter "ruby http-server.rb". The server is now running.

Note: If you close this command window, the server will stop.

You can verify that the server is running correctly by running some
sample tests.

#      Start a new command shell.
#      Enter "ruby c:\scripting101\solutions\suite.rb -b".

Note: These tests will run unbearably slowly if Internet Explorer is 
configured to use a proxy server that happens to be unavailable.
