<h1>Scripting for Testers</h1>

	<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>

	<p>These instructions describe how to install the software we&#8217;ll use in
our Scripting for Testers class.</p>

	<p>We will be using Ruby (a programming language) and the <span class="caps">IE </span>Controller
(a library) on your machine to test server software running on your
instructor&#8217;s machine. You can also run the server software on your own
machine, if you prefer. This may come in handy if you can&#8217;t get on the
classroom network, or if you want to use a test technique that
requires a dedicated server.</p>

	<h3>Hardware Requirements</h3>

	<p><B>The class software runs on Windows machines. We recommend Windows 2000
or Windows XP. You should have Administrator privileges.</B></p>

	<p>We believe that it will also work on Windows NT and Windows 98, but we
don&#8217;t support these in our classes. (Our experience has been that
machines that are still running these operating systems are either too
slow or have other problems and are a drain on our attention. Sorry.)</p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">IE </span>Controller software requires Internet Explorer and therefore
only runs on Windows. The Timeclock server was developed on a
Macintosh, and should run on any machine supporting Ruby (Unix, Linux,
Windows). The Timeclock &#8220;product tests&#8221; will not run on Windows using
the mswin build (the one you use for the class). They will run on
Windows using the cygwin build.</p>

	<h3>Installing the Software</h3>

	<h4>Ruby</h4>

	<p>The Ruby installer is
<a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167&#38;release_id=414">ruby181-12.exe.</a> </p>

	<ol>
	<li>     Double-click this exe file to install.</li>
		<li>     Select the default installation options (choose all options; install in c:/ruby). </li>
		<li>     If you are installing as Administrator you don&#8217;t need to restart windows. Otherwise, you should. </li>
	</ol>

	<h4><span class="caps">IE </span>Controller</h4>

	<p>You will need to install one Ruby library:
<a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=104&#38;release_id=305">iec.2004.054.0.zip</a>    </p>

	<ol>
	<li>     Unzip this file into a new directory on your computer. </li>
		<li>     Start up a command shell. (Start-> Run, enter &#8220;cmd&#8221;.)</li>
		<li>     Change the current directory (cd) to the one you just created.</li>
		<li>     Type &#8220;ruby install.rb&#8221; </li>
	</ol>

	<p>(You can also install this by just double-clicking the install.rb icon
in windows explorer. The problem with this method is that you won&#8217;t
see any error messages.) </p>

	<h4>Scripting Class Materials.</h4>

	<ol>
	<li>Copy the contents of the scripting101 into your hard drive, to c:/wtr/scripting101. </li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Running the Timeclock Server.</h3>

	<p>You probably won&#8217;t need to do this for class, since you can use your
instructor&#8217;s server. Otherwise, here is how to start up a timeclock
server on your machine. </p>

	<ol>
	<li>In a command window, cd to c:/wtr/scripting101/installs/timeclock/bin.</li>
		<li>In a command window, &#8220;ruby http-server.rb&#8221; </li>
		<li>You can verify the installation by running some of the sample scripts:
	<ul>
	<li>ruby c:/wtr/scripting101/lab/solutions/suite.rb</li>
	</ul></li>
	</ol>
