<h1>Scripting for Testers</h1>

	<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>

	<p>These instructions describe how to install the software we&#8217;ll use for our Scripting for Testers class.</p>

	<p>You will be using Ruby (a programming language) and the <span class="caps">IE </span>Controller (a library) on your machine to test server software running on your instructor&#8217;s machine. You can also run the server software on your own machine. This may come in handy if you can&#8217;t get on the classroom network, or if you want to use a test technique that requires a dedicated server.</p>

	<h3>Hardware Requirements</h3>

	<p>The class software runs on Windows machines. We recommend Windows 2000 or Windows XP. We believe that it will also work on Windows NT and Windows 98, but we don&#8217;t support these in our classes. (Our experience has been that machines that are still running these operating systems are either too slow or have other problems and are a drain on our attention. Sorry.)</p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">IE </span>Controller software requires Internet Explorer and therefore only runs on Windows. The Timeclock server was developed on a Macintosh and also runs on Windows. We believe that it can also run on any Unix/Linux machine.</p>

	<h3>Installing the Software</h3>

	<h4>Ruby</h4>

	<p>The Ruby installer is ruby180-10.exe.</p>

	<p>1.      Double-click this exe file to install.</p>

	<p>2.      Select the default installation options (choose all options; install in c:/ruby).</p>

	<p>3.      If you are installing as Administrator you don&#8217;t need to restart windows. Otherwise, you should.</p>

	<h4><span class="caps">IE </span>Controller</h4>

	<p>You will need to install one Ruby library: iec.2004.054.0.zip   </p>

	<p>1.      Start up a command shell. (Start-> Run, enter cmd.)</p>

	<p>2.      Change the current directory (cd) to the one containing the utility.</p>

	<p>3.      Type &#8220;ruby install.rb&#8221; </p>

	<p>(You can also install this by just double-clicking the icon in windows explorer. The problem with this method is that you won&#8217;t see any error messages if there is a problem.)</p>

	<h4>Scripting Class Materials.</h4>

	<p>1. Copy the contents of the scripting101 into your harddrive, to c:/wtr/scripting101.</p>

	<h4>Running the Timeclock Server.</h4>

	<p>You probably won&#8217;t need to do this in class, since you can use your instructor&#8217;s server. Otherwise, here is how to start up a timeclock server on your machine.</p>

	<p>1. Set VW_TIMECLOCK_DATA_DIR to be c:/tmp/timeclock.</p>

	<p>2. In a command window, cd to c:/wtr/scripting101/installs/timeclock/bin.</p>

	<p>3. In a command window, &#8220;ruby http-server.rb&#8221; </p>

	<p>4. You can verify the installation by running some of the sample scripts:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>c:/wtr/scripting101/solutions/lab-suite.rb</li>
	</ul>
