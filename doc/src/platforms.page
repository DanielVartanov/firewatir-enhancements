h2. Internet Explorer and Windows

This version of Watir works with Internet Explorer and Windows. It works with
IE 5.5, 6 and 7 and Windows 2000, XP, 2003 Server and Vista.

Support for other platforms is currently provided by separate ports. We have 
plans to eventually roll together the following Watir ports into a single package.

h2. Firefox

"FireWatir":http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/FireWatir+-+WATiR+for+FireFox 
is the Watir port for Firefox. It works on Windows, Linux and Mac

h2. Safari and MacOS

"SafariWatir":http://safariwatir.rubyforge.org/ is a Watir port for Safari on the Mac.

h2. Other Browsers

Selenium is a popular open-source testing tool that supports most browsers,
including Opera, Camino and Konqueror. The Selenium-RC library includes Ruby 
support. We have demonstrated "a Watir interface that 
uses Selenium":http://awta.wikispaces.com/Common+Driver+for+Selenium+and+Watir
to drive a browser, and expect to eventually grow this into a full-blown port.
