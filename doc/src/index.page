h2. Overview

WATIR stands for "Web Application Testing in Ruby". 
Watir is a free, open-source functional testing tool for automating 
browser-based tests of web applications. It is pronounced _water._

Watir drives browsers the same way people do. 
It clicks links, fills in forms, presses buttons. Watir also checks results, 
such as whether expected text appears on the page.

Watir is a Ruby library that works with Internet Explorer on Windows. 
Like other general-purpose programming languages, Ruby gives you the power to 
connect to databases, read data files, export XML and structure your 
code into reusable libraries.
