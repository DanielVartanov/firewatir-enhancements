h2. Install Ruby

First you need to "install Ruby":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167 using
the one-click installer for Windows.
*We recommend Ruby 1.8.5-24 or Ruby 1.8.6-26 final (or later)*

However, if you wish to use Watir's support for the IE showModalDialog
then you must use Ruby 1.8.2-15 (or 1.8.2-14). This is the dialog that is 
posted with the showModalDialog() JavaScript command and is supported
with Watir's ie.modal_dialog command.

h2. Install Watir

Watir is packaged as a _gem_, a Ruby library that can be installed
over the internet. 

Watir 1.5 was first released in September 2007. To install the latest
version, type these two commands at a command prompt:

  gem update --system 
  gem install watir

The first command will update the gem system itself. This is required
to install Watir gems beginning with Watir 1.5.4 (April 2008).

Watir 1.4 was released in August 2005. If you are upgrading from it,
see these notes.

* "Upgrading from Watir 1.4":http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Development+Builds

h2. Install the IE Developer Toolbar

We recommend using the DOM Explorer, packaged with the 
"IE Developer Toolbar.":http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=e59c3964-672d-4511-bb3e-2d5e1db91038&displaylang=en
This quickly shows you the element attributes and properties you 
need to know to automate them with Watir.

After installing the toolbar, select Tools -> Toolbars -> Explorer Bar -> IE DOM Explorer.
