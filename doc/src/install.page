h2. Install Ruby

First you need to "install Ruby":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167 using
the one-click installer for Windows.
*We recommend Ruby 1.8.2-14 or later.*

However, if you wish to use Watir's support for the *IE web modal dialog*
then you "must use Ruby 1.8.2-14":http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Installation
and not a more recent version. This dialog is
posted with the showModalDialog() JavaScript command and is supported with Watir's
ie.modal_dialog command.

h2. Install Watir 1.4

Watir is packaged as a _gem_, a Ruby library that can be installed over the internet.

Watir 1.4 is a stable version. To install it, simply type this at a command prompt:

<pre>
gem install watir
</pre>

h2. Install Watir 1.5

Watir 1.5 is under development. It is also pretty stable but is not 
documented as well as Watir 1.4.
