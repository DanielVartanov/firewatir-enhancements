h2. Install Ruby

First you need to "install Ruby":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167 using
the one-click installer for Windows.
*We recommend Ruby 1.8.2-14 or later.*

However, if you wish to use Watir's support for the *IE web modal dialog*
then you "must use Ruby 1.8.2-14":http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Install+Ruby
and not a more recent version. (This dialog is the one that is 
posted with the showModalDialog() JavaScript command and is supported with Watir's
ie.modal_dialog command.)

h2. Install Watir 1.5

Watir is packaged as a _gem_, a Ruby library that can be installed over the internet.

Watir 1.5 is under development. It is pretty stable but is not 
documented as well as Watir 1.4.

* "Installing the latest development gem":http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Install+Watir
* "Other development gems available":http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Development+Builds
* "Upgrading from Watir 1.4":http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Development+Builds

h2. Install Watir 1.4

Watir 1.4 is a stable version. To install it, simply type this at a command prompt:

  gem install watir

h2. Install the IE Developer Toolbar

We recommend using the DOM Explorer, packaged with the 
"IE Developer Toolbar.":http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=e59c3964-672d-4511-bb3e-2d5e1db91038&displaylang=en
This quickly shows you the element attributes and properties you 
need to know to automate them with Watir.

After installing the toolbar, select Tools -> Toolbars -> Explorer Bar -> IE DOM Explorer.
